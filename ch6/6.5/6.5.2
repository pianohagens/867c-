/*
6.5.2: Multiple vectors: Key and value.

For any element in keysList with a value greater than 100, print the corresponding value in itemsList, followed by a space. 
Ex: If keysList = {42, 105, 101, 100} and itemsList = {10, 20, 30, 40}, print:
20 30 
Since keysList[1] and keysList[2] have values greater than 100, the value of itemsList[1] and itemsList[2] are printed.
