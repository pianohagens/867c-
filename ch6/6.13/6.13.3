/*
6.13.3: Printing array elements with a for loop.
Write a for loop to print all elements in courseGrades, following each element with a space (including the last). Print forwards, then backwards. End each loop with a newline. Ex: If courseGrades = {7, 9, 11, 10}, print:

7 9 11 10 
10 11 9 7 

Hint: Use two for loops. Second loop starts with i = NUM_VALS - 1. (Notes)

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   const int NUM_VALS = 4;
   int courseGrades[NUM_VALS];
   int i = 0;

   courseGrades[0] = 7;
   courseGrades[1] = 9;
   courseGrades[2] = 11;
   courseGrades[3] = 10;

   /* Your solution goes here  */
   for (i = 0; i < NUM_VALS; ++i) {
         cout << courseGrades[i] << " ";  
      }
  cout << endl;
  for (i = NUM_VALS-1; i>=0; i--) {
         cout << courseGrades[i] << " ";
